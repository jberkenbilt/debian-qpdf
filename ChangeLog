	* make/rules.mk: fix logic with .dep generation for .lo files so
	that dependencies work properly with libtool

2008-05-05  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/qpdf/MD5.hh: fix header to be 64-bit clean

	* configure.ac: add tests for sized integer types

2008-05-04  Jay Berkenbilt  <ejb@ql.org>

	* libqpdf/QPDF_encryption.cc: do not assume size_t is unsigned int

	* qpdf/qtest/qpdf.test: removed locale-specific tests.  These were
	really to check bugs in perl 5.8.0 and are obsolete now.  They
	also make the test suite fail in some environments that don't have
	all the locales fully configured.

	* various: updated several files for gcc 4.3 by adding missing
	includes (string.h, stdlib.h)

	* 2.0: initial public release
